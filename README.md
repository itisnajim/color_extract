Color Extract is a Flutter package that allows you to extract and calculate colors from your app's widgets.
You can use it to change the color of a widget depending/based on the color of the background (the other widget behind).

Installation
------------

Add the following to your `pubspec.yaml`:


```yaml
dependencies:
  color_extract: ^1.0.1
```

Then run `flutter pub get`.

Usage
-----

### ColorExtractor

The `ColorExtractor` it's the widget we want to extract the average color from. It serves as a wrapper for RepaintBoundary, so you can utilize RepaintBoundary as an alternative.

```dart
ColorExtractor(
  boundaryKey: GlobalKey(),
  child: Container(
    width: 200,
    height: 200,
    color: Colors.red,
  ),
);
```

### ColorAverager

The `ColorAverager` widget computes the average color of a specific portion of either `ColorExtractor` or `RepaintBoundary`. Its application is useful in determining the dominant color of a certain area, such as the background behind a logo, image.

```dart
ColorAverager(
  boundaryKey: GlobalKey(),
  child: SizedBox(
    width: 50,
    height: 50,
  ),
  onChanged: (color) {
    // Handle the new average color.
  },
);
```

You can also use the `ColorAveragerController` to calculate the average color programmatically.

```dart
final controller = ColorAveragerController();

// ... render the widget ...

final avgColor = await controller.calculateAvgColor();
```

Example
-------

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:color_extract/color_extract.dart';

class MyHomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      body: Stack(
        children: [
          ColorExtractor(
            boundaryKey: boundaryKey,
            child: Container(
              width: 200,
              height: 200,
              color: Colors.blue,
            ),
          ),
          ColorAverager(
            // boundaryKey should be the same one in the above ColorExtractor boundaryKey
            boundaryKey: boundaryKey,
            // You can use the controller (ColorAveragerController) too.
            // controller: controller,
            child: const SizedBox(width: 50, height: 50),
            onChanged: (color) {
                // Do something with the average color.
                // color should be = Colors.blue
            },
          )
        ],
      )
    );
  }
}
```
